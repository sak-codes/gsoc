# 🚀 About Me: Sakshi Oza 


*“Science explores, data explains, open-source develops and creativity connects the dots.”* 

Hi, I’m **Sakshi Oza** – a data science and open source passionate about bridging the gap between **healthcare, technology, and innovation**. I’ve spent my last few years exploring the intersection of **data and health**, turning numbers into insights and ideas into impactful solutions.  

With a strong foundation from my **M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering** at **IIT Gandhinagar**, I honed my skills in applying technology to solve complex medical challenges. Now, as a **Master of Data Science in Health** student at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**, I continue to combine analytical thinking with computational tools to advance healthcare diagnostics and outcomes. I believe data tells stories waiting to be heard – stories that can save lives, improve care, and transform healthcare.  


## A Glimpse of My Work 🌟  

- **📈 Google Summer of Code (2023):**  
   Boosted graph computation efficiency by **30%** through optimized data structures and advanced algorithms, contributing to **Open Science Labs**.  
   
- **🩺 Healthcare ML Projects:**  
   Achieved **97.5% AUC** in predicting cardiovascular risks using PCA, K-means clustering, and LASSO regression with datasets from **NHANES**.  

- **📚 Research & Innovation:**  
   Co-authored *“Ultrasound Biomarkers: Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound and Nakagami Imaging to Differentiate Benign and Malignant Choroidal Tumors”*, published in *Current Eye Research*.  

- **🎖 Accolades:**  
   Best Poster Finalist at **IEEE South Asian Ultrasonics Symposium** for my work on intraocular tumor differentiation using Nakagami envelope statistics.  


## Beyond the Numbers and Code 🎨

When I’m not decoding and playing with the datasets, you’ll find me:  
- 📷 **Capturing Moments**: Photography is my creative escape, where I freeze fleeting moments and tell stories through the lens. 
- 🎶 **Tuning into Music**: Whether it’s classical melodies or upbeat tunes, music keeps me grounded and energized.  


## Let’s Connect 🌍

I’m always excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and create impactful solutions through data and open source. Let’s connect and build something extraordinary together!
