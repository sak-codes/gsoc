I will be sharing my Pre-GSoC journey in this blog. I started exploring about the GSoC program around November 2019 and was quite interested in the open source. I began to look for the organisations and came across a Math and Physics library in python, [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/).

I looked in the project ideas and the one idea which hit me the most was from the stats module. I was quite excited to work on it as I recently had a course on Probability and Statistics. I went through the code base of `stats`, started learning more about the subject along with contributing to the codebase.

I struggled a bit in the first week as I was new with the GitHub and met [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807) when he reviewed one of my PR. I started discussing with him about his experience as a GSoC student in 2019, and gained many things about the organisation and `stats` module. It was from the middle December, I started contributing to this library and it has became one of my top priority till date as it is something that matches my interests and tastes.

Finally, I am happy to share that on 4th May, 2020, I was accepted as a GSoC student of [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/). I would work during the summer of 2020 on `stats` module under the mentorship of [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), [Francesco Bonazzi](https://github.com/Upabjojr) and [Jogi Miglani](https://github.com/jmig5776).

And that was the beginning of the Mathematically Programmed Summer.
