Last week, I focused mainly on continuing with the implementation of the CPP backend for the algorithms under the linear data structures submodule.
The [open PR](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/543) for the same is near to the completion and will be ready to merge after some
minor fixes as suggested by my mentors. I also discussed the issue with the current and new design implementation on the Lazy Segment Trees
which I was working on in [this PR](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/539). I will try to fix the issue using `__setitem__` to avoid
creating confusion in updating and replacing a single element.
