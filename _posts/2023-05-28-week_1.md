In the initial week of my contributing period, I dedicated my efforts to gaining a thorough understanding of the codebase, which allowed me to grasp the underlying structure and functionality of the project. As a result, I successfully implemented the Edmond Karp Algorithm, a crucial algorithm for finding maximum flow in a network. The [pull request](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/530) has been merged.

Moving forward, my focus for the following week will be completing the Ford Fulkerson algorithm and exploring additional graph algorithms aligning with the project requirements.
