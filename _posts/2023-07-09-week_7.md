I have completed my half of Google Summer of code journey, and as per the plan, most of the python-related work from my proposal is covered.
In the last week, I started working on implemening CPP backend of the functionsm under the `linear_data_structures` sub-module using Python-C api.

As a start, I started working on the [bubble Sort CPP backend](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/540). The PR is almost ready to be merged
and following this PR, I will start working on other such implementations in the next week.
