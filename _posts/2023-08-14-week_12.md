With the last week, it marks the wonderful journey of the Google Summer of Code. I have learnt a lot and
I am glad to be part of this special program.

I worked on completing one my open PRs on [lazy segment trees](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/539)
during the last week. The other PR of my last phase on adding CPP backend for the [search algorithms](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/544)
was merged. I'll complete my final report and submit to the main website.

I would also like to thank **Gagandeep Singh** and **Smit Lunagariya** for their constant support and guidance throughout the project timeline.
