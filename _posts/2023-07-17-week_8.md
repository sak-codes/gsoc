I completed my eight weeks of the Google Summer of Code journey, and it's fun to start with the CPP implementation of the proposal.
As planned, I have worked on adding the [CPP backend for selection sort](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/542) using the Python-C API.
Moreover, I also fixed one of the issues that was [failing the CI silently](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/issues/541) due to an 
incorrect path of the root directory.

In the coming week, I'll work on completing the CPP implementation of other quadratic time sorting algorithms.
