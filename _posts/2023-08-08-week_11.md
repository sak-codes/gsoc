In the previous week, I completed [CPP implementation](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/544) of
search algorithms under the linear data structures module.
As this marks the end of second last week of the Google Summer of Code, I will be focusing on finishing my pending PRs as well as preparing
the final report for the submission. I would like to thank Gagandeep Singh and Smit Lunagariya for the wonderful support.
