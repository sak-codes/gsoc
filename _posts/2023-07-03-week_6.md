This is the time where I have almost completed the half of my Google Summer of Code journey and it has been a wonderful learning experience.

Last week, I completed the [test function](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/535) PR which now merged.
It was tested thoroughly by the mentors and as well as used it for testing the CI too. It was my first experience with the CI
and it was great.

I also started working on the [Lazy Segment tree](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/539) implementation which
allows range updates in $O(logN)$. I will continuing working on this and test this robustly after it's completion.
