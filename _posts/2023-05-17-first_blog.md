### Pre GSoc 2023

In December 2022, I started exploring the world of open-source software and became fascinated by its potential. GSoC grabbed my attention, and I began searching for organizations to contribute to. That is when I stumbled upon the PyDatastructs library.

In March 2023, I began using PyDataStructs and was amazed by its capabilities. It provides a comprehensive set of data structures and algorithm features, all conveniently bundled in a single package. Among these features, my favorite is the Segment tree. This efficient and flexible data structure performs exceptionally well in range queries and updates tasks. 

I faced challenges during my first week as I was new to GitHub. However, I received assistance from [Smit Lunagariya](https://github.com/Smit-create) and [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), who kindly reviewed one of my pull requests. I took this opportunity to discuss Smit's experience as a GSoC student in 2020, learning valuable insights about the organization. Since then, I have been actively contributing to the library, and exploring new opportunities.

I am excited to share that on May 4th, 2023, I received acceptance as a GSoC contributor for PyDataStructs. I am grateful for the opportunity to work during the summer of 2023 with mentors **_Gagandeep Singh, Smit Lunagariya, Saransh Chopra, Ivan Ogasawara, and Alex de Siqueira_**. Being part of this program and contributing to developing PyDataStructs is a privilege.

**_And so, the Programmed Summer began, igniting a season of coding adventures and innovation._**
