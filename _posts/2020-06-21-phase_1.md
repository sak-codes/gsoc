With this blog it completes the awesome month of statistical learning and coding, and the official Phase 1 of the Google Summer of Code-2020.

I will try to highlight some notable additions to `stats` during this month.

  * [#19273](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19273)
     * Added Lomax and Bounded Pareto Distributions(CRV types).

  * [#19290](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19290)
     * Fixes Symbolic `Expectation` and its `doit` method.

  * [#19295](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19295)
     * Rename `doit` to `expand` in Symbolic `stats`.

  * [#19304](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19304)
     * Added `is_random` to check for random expressions.

  * [#19342](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19342)

  * [#19459](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19459)
     * Fixes `Sum.doit()` for `RandomIndexedSymbol`.

  * [#19500](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19500)
     * Added support for Sampling from Stochatic Processes.

  * [#19529](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19529)
